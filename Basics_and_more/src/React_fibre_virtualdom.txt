react Fibre 
this concept came into the act as we know react compares virtual dom 
and our personal fav when updating react must wait for sometime to update so that it can update more data at once and 

The goal of React Fiber is to increase its suitability for areas like animation, layout, and gestures

reconciliation
The algorithm React uses to diff one tree with another to determine which parts need to be changed.

when you render a React application, a tree of nodes that describes the app is generated and saved in memory. This tree is then flushed to the rendering environment 
— for example, in the case of a browser application, it's translated to a set of DOM operations. When the app is updated (usually via setState), a new tree is generated. 
The new tree is diffed with the previous tree to compute which operations are needed to update the rendered app.
